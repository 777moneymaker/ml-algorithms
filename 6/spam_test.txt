-1 | text: sitara positionplease use the position manager home button .when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view detailsor change the dates , the position manager keepsall your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use theback and forward buttons to keep your views running .on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend togo back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harderto keep all the old views active and updated .the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you hadup when you hit apply . by clicking this button , yourposition manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,the position manager is still keeping all the your views forthe day running in the backgound .what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear outthe old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the positiongets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as faras the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still beslow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change tolimit the number of active views you can have open , but at this timei am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , pleaseremember to use your home button .other helpful hints -did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show toolbar text labels -did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top andzones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel -if you have an omicron position porfolio - your min / max button shows youactual - and min / max for your day swing deals .same works for nom flex portfolio .

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy tosee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keepthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignmentgauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before youclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " thatoften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great tohear that so many people are enjoying the tips .talk to you again in a few weeks .jon garbisonon - line editorwoodsmithvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :100 + woodworking plans :woodsmith magazine :shopnotes magazine :workbench magazine :kits , jigs , tools , project plans :back issues :woodworking forums :to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again atto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :note : your subscribed email address is

"( emphasis added . )further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes fromthe commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause forhearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day andseasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to matchmore closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its orderno . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanismsbased on marginal cost principles[ 65 , 236 ]for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding oreliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish theprice for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more closematching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on averagecosts . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will notbe adopted .affirmed and reversed - see next paragraphcomm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos .er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 )turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctlyrejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' sinterpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidencewhatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months .without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to makea judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . wetherefore uphold the judge on this point .we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' sincremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings methodproposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions arearranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on costestimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costsrise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utilitymay terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staffin that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not bemade as frequently .related to pmasreg - preamble , fercsr ?
